  Princeton Emacs is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup
  experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or
  anything else. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants
  in any form.

  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
  sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
  race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
  intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
  recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
  inappropriate physical contact, derisive comments regarding
  technical background, and unwelcome sexual attention.

  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
  comply immediately.

  All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
  including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
  imagery is not appropriate for any meetup, including talks.

  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup
  organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
  warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund (if
  applicable). In the event of serious infractions of the code of
  conduct, Princeton Emacs staff may share incident details and
  offenders’ names with third parties including but not limited to:
  venue staff, local law enforcement, and staff of other
  meetups/conferences. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
  else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a
  member of meetup staff immediately.
